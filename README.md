# deep-learning-challenge

Project Name
AlphabetSoupCharity Deep Learning Model

Overview
This project involves the development and optimization of a deep learning model for AlphabetSoupCharity, a non-profit organization. The purpose is to create a predictive model that can effectively identify successful and impactful charitable organizations, improving the allocation of resources.

Dependencies
Python 3.x
Jupyter Notebook
TensorFlow
Pandas
NumPy
Scikit-learn

Data
The dataset (charity_data.csv) contains information about various charitable organizations, including features that influence their success.

Model Architecture
The deep neural network model comprises multiple layers with varying numbers of neurons and activation functions. Refer to the Jupyter Notebook for the detailed model architecture.

Optimization Steps
The model optimization involved:

Dropping highly correlated columns
Adjusting neural network architecture
Adding more neurons and hidden layers
Fine-tuning the number of training epochs

Results
The optimized model achieved an accuracy of 72.5%, falling slightly short of the target. Refer to the Jupyter Notebook for detailed results.

Next Steps
Further exploration of hyperparameter tuning
Experimentation with different activation functions
Iterative testing and refinement of the model architecture
